üîß Potential Extensions
1. Backtest Engine Integration
Load historical candles and simulate trades over them using configurable strategies.

Add entry/exit rules, PnL tracking, and performance metrics (win rate, profit factor, drawdown).

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from backtest.core import run_backtest
results = run_backtest(candles, strategy=my_strategy)
2. Smart Money Structure Analyzer
Auto-detect:

Break of structure (BoS)

Liquidity sweeps

Order blocks / fair value gaps

Compression zones

Could output a list of dicts with timestamps, types, and labels.

This will directly power your 0DTE thesis generator later.

3. Interactive Charting
Use plotly or bokeh to create zoomable, annotated charts.

Overlay VWAP, zones, entry/exit points, compression markers, etc.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from charting.interactive import plot_candles_with_zones
plot_candles_with_zones(candles, zones=detected_zones)
4. Data Export & Snapshot Archive
Store processed candle data + analysis as JSON/CSV.

Save to disk or cloud for future replay.

Optional:

Timestamp folders

Include snapshot of key levels or market structure

5. Relative Strength Module
Compare SPX vs sector ETFs or tickers using the same time window.

Output a ranking list of strong vs weak assets.

6. Custom Query Config
Allow the user to input:

Symbol

Time range

Granularity

üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Path (in order)
‚úÖ Phase 1: Chart Core

Build base_plot.py ‚Üí chart candles, overlays, volume.

Support vertical lines, shaded zones, arrows, etc.

üîÑ Phase 2: Annotations Layer

Build annotations.py to store overlay logic.

Build state_manager.py to persist annotations.

‚è± Phase 3: Aggregation

Add aggregators.py to transform candles on-the-fly (e.g., 1-min ‚Üí 5-min).

üîÆ Phase 4: Interactivity (Optional)

Add interactive.py for draggable zones, live drawing.
